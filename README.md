# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition based on sensor data - PADMAP2 using different ML models

# PAMAP2 dataset
Dataset based on the [PAMAP2 Dataset for Physical Activity Monitoring](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PAMAP2+Physical+Activity+Monitoring).

The dataset consists of data from 3 IMU(inertial measurement units) sensors and 1 â€“ heart rate monitor all capturing 18 physical activities performed by 9 subjects. In total there are 52 features and 3.8 million instances captured from all the sensors amounting to activities like walking, sleeping, lying etc.

# Project presentation and review report
